# Roadmap & Open Items

Candidate next work, derived from gaps between [../SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) / [../README.md](../README.md)
and the current code. **These are proposals to prioritize, not commitments.** When a item is
picked up, move it to [log.md](log.md) on completion.

## Status snapshot

Core archive, pedigree UI, GEDCOM import/export, DNA shared-match lineage, OpenRouter AI utilities,
**AI family books + editable per-person biographies**, and reusable tree-wide sources/citations are
live and working. The app is **single-super-admin** today (roadmap A is still the unblocker).
Automated gates: **eslint + `tsc --noEmit` + Vitest (204 tests)**, wired into `npm run build` and
into husky hooks (`pre-commit`: lint+typecheck; `pre-push`: full build gate). Last reconciled with
git/code 2026-06-29.

## Candidate next work

### A. Multi-user collaboration (schema-ready, no UI)
The DB already models this: `tree_collaborators` (roles owner/editor, invite-by-email/profile,
status), and `can_read_tree`/`can_write_tree` already honor active collaborators. But there is
**no registration or collaborator-management UI**, and auth is a local super-admin in
`localStorage` ([decisions/local-superadmin-auth.md](decisions/local-superadmin-auth.md)).
- Wire Supabase Auth (email/OAuth) → real `auth.users` / `profiles`.
- Build a collaborators panel (invite, set role, revoke) on top of existing RLS.
- Migrate super-admin bootstrap onto a real account.
- **Highest-leverage** item: unlocks the security model the schema was built for.

### B. Retire / consolidate the legacy force graph — DONE 2026-06-26
Deleted [../components/FamilyTree.tsx](../components/FamilyTree.tsx). It could never render:
`layoutType` was `useState<TreeLayoutType>('pedigree')` with **no setter**, so the
`layoutType === 'pedigree' ? <PedigreeTree/> : <FamilyTree/>` ternary always took the pedigree branch
— the force-graph else-branch was dead code. Removed the component, its App import, the dead branch,
and the now-unused `layoutType` state + `TreeLayoutType` import. Bundle dropped **765→703 KB** (d3-force
gone). Its one useful trait — `RelationshipConfidence` edge encoding — was already ported into the live
pedigree view (L1, 2026-06-26). The layout-persistence/audit subsystem (`persistFamilyLayout` /
`fetchFamilyLayoutAudits` → admin Database panel; `onPersistFamilyLayout` → PersonProfile) is **separate
and retained**. Decision updated: [decisions/pedigree-over-force-graph.md](decisions/pedigree-over-force-graph.md).

### C. Test coverage — DONE 2026-06-20
Vitest added; **54 tests** cover DNA CSV parsing (`lib/dnaRawParser.ts`), cM-classification
(`lib/dnaClassification.ts`), place parsing, the AI cache, and **GEDCOM parse + serialize +
round-trip** (`lib/gedcomParser.ts`, both `parseGedcom` and `serializeGedcom` extracted from
`ImportExport.tsx`). `npm test` is **wired into the build gate** (`npm run build`), so failing
tests block the Vercel deploy.
**Remaining:** broaden coverage into `services/archive.ts` mapping helpers (`mapDbRelationship`,
person/place mappers); consider component/UI tests (would need jsdom).

### D. DNA UX polish — DONE 2026-06-20
- ✅ Profile DNA tab ([../components/person-profile/DNATab.tsx](../components/person-profile/DNATab.tsx))
  now shows the **same resolved-lineage verdict** as the admin panel — path found + **cM
  compatibility** (compatible / "review cM mismatch" / no path) + cM prediction — via the shared,
  tested `describeSharedLineage` helper in [../lib/dnaClassification.ts](../lib/dnaClassification.ts)
  (mirrors the resolver's `pathFitsPrediction`/`predictionLabel`). Previously it showed only a
  relationship-link count. SPEC §6.3 parity achieved.
- Follow-ups: the full human-readable `pathLabel` (names) still shows only in the admin panel —
  surfacing it in the profile would need name plumbing or persisting the label. Also confirm a
  *mismatched* path persists `sharedPathRelationshipIds` so the badge survives reload for that case.
- shared-cM ranges doc maintained: [sources/dna-cm-ranges.md](sources/dna-cm-ranges.md) cross-links
  the `supportsRelationshipHops` thresholds that drive the verdict.

### E. GEDCOM fidelity
- Audit unsupported-tag warning coverage; ensure source+citation context is preserved on import
  (SPEC §5). Consider round-trip tests (import → export → diff).
- After import, set a sensible `defaultProbandId` on the new tree so the interactive tree opens on
  a chosen root rather than the arbitrary `treePeople[0]` (see 2026-06-20 tree-switch fix in log).

### H. GEDCOM 7.0 alignment — full gap analysis in [sources/gedcom7-alignment.md](sources/gedcom7-alignment.md)
Structure the schema + code around FamilySearch GEDCOM 7.0 while still importing 5.x. Phased:
- **P0 — DONE 2026-06-20:** `lib/gedcomTokenizer.ts` (`CONC`/`CONT` merge — recovers dropped
  notes, BOM strip, `@@` un-escape, `HEAD.GEDC.VERS` detect, `@VOID@`); `RESN` privacy on import.
- **Export — DONE 2026-06-20:** `serializeGedcom` now emits **GEDCOM 7.0 only** (BOM, `VERS 7.0`,
  `SCHMA` for `_LIVING`, valid xrefs + `UID`, structured names, `SEX` M/F/X/U, `RESN`, upper-cased
  dates, `CONT`). Verified on the real 2148-person tree.
- **P1 (schema spine):** structured dates (calendars/ranges/approx/BCE/PHRASE — lossless), `NAME`
  parts + `TYPE` + `TRAN`, `SEX` → M/F/X/U, full event detail (`TYPE`/`AGE`/`CAUS`/`AGNC`/value`),
  `QUAY` 0–3, and `UID`/`EXID`/`REFN` (also fixes export round-trip ids).
  > **Done 2026-06-27 — P1 structured dates (the date spine):** [../lib/gedcomDate.ts](../lib/gedcomDate.ts)
  > parses GEDCOM 5.5.1/7 dates losslessly into a `StructuredDate` (`raw` verbatim + calendar +
  > qualifier + range bounds + BCE + phrase; `representativeYear`/`formatStructuredDate`). Adopted in
  > `extractBirthYear` (range → start year, behavior-preserving) so lifespan/data-quality/books all
  > gain structured interpretation with zero test regressions (19 parser tests).
  > **Done 2026-06-29 — P1 UID/EXID/REFN:** [../lib/gedcomParser.ts](../lib/gedcomParser.ts) now
  > captures `UID`, `EXID` (+`EXID.TYPE`), and `REFN` (+`TYPE`) from INDI records into
  > `person.metadata` (jsonb — no migration) and re-emits them on export; the original source `UID`
  > is preserved verbatim instead of being overwritten with the internal id, so import→export keeps
  > identity (5 round-trip tests).
  > **Done 2026-06-29 — P1 QUAY:** source-citation certainty (0–3) is now typed (`Quay` on `Citation`,
  > [../lib/sourceQuality.ts](../lib/sourceQuality.ts) `parseQuay`/labels, 5 tests) and **surfaced as a
  > Certainty selector in the Sources tab** ([../components/person-profile/SourcesTab.tsx](../components/person-profile/SourcesTab.tsx)).
  > The data already round-tripped via the `quality` column + the exporter's `1 QUAY`; this adds the
  > typed field, validates 0–3, and lets a curator set it per citation. **Remaining P1:** persisting the
  > structured date (schema), `NAME` parts/`TYPE`/`TRAN`, full event detail (`AGE`/`CAUS`/`AGNC`).
- **P2:** new records — `REPO`, `SNOTE`, `OBJE`/MIME multi-file, `ASSO` associations.
- **P3:** compliant GEDCOM 7.0 exporter + `SCHMA` extension declarations + round-trip tests.
- Cross-cutting: keep raw GEDCOM payload for lossless round-trip; capture `gedcom_version` per import.

### F. AI utilities — DONE 2026-06-20
- ✅ Deterministic fallback for place parsing (`lib/placeParser.ts`); `parsePlaceString` now
  backfills/merges instead of returning bare `{ fullText }`.
- ✅ In-memory bounded caching (`lib/aiCache.ts`) for `parsePlaceString` + `normalizeDeathCause`.
- Possible follow-ups: persist the cache to `localStorage` across sessions; add deterministic
  fallbacks for `generateBio` / `analyzeHistoricalEra` (currently still key-dependent).

### G. Performance guardrails
- SPEC §7 demands no full-tree hydration. Add a lightweight check/benchmark on large trees
  (the 37 P. Gamby CSV / Big-Andersen GEDCOM fixtures in the repo root are useful test data).

### I. Historical calendar & date conversion (hard; design carefully) — see [sources/historical-dates.md](sources/historical-dates.md)
Julian ↔ Gregorian is **not** a single global toggle — Gregorian adoption ranged from 1582
(Catholic Europe) to 1752 (Britain/colonies), **1753 (Sweden/Finland)**, 1918 (Russia)… so
conversion must be keyed off **place + date** and is often ambiguous.
- **Foundation (part of P1 dates):** persist the raw date text + GEDCOM 7 calendar tag
  (`GREGORIAN`/`JULIAN`/`FRENCH_R`/`HEBREW`) + `PHRASE`; **never silently coerce to Gregorian**.
  Must represent Julian, BCE, ranges/approximations, and oddities like **30 FEB 1712** (the real
  Swedish-calendar date — Sweden's 1700–1712 anomaly + 1753 switch).
- **Conversion:** opt-in, place/era-aware, with assumptions surfaced — not a global setting.
- **Advanced (optional, later):** resolve church-record date forms — movable feasts
  (Fastlagssöndagen, Pingstdagen…), name-days (Hindersmässan = St Henrik = 19 Jan), and Latin
  medieval dating — to civil dates (essentially the *Almanacka för 500 år* algorithm). Until then,
  preserve the original phrase verbatim. Relevant to the Danish/Swedish `.ged` files we import.

### J. AI Family Books — DONE 2026-06-20
The fourth pillar of the product goal (AI-written family-history books + PDF export) is live.
See the [log entry](log.md) and [concepts/ai-family-books.md](concepts/ai-family-books.md).
- ✅ Pure planning (`lib/bookComposer.ts`, 15 tests), AI composers with deterministic fallbacks
  (`services/ai.ts`), orchestration + Supabase persistence (`services/books.ts`), `family_books`
  migration (applied), Administrator → **Books** tab, print-to-PDF overlay (`components/book/*`),
  scoped `@media print` in `index.css`. Zero new deps.
- **Follow-ups (open):** in-UI chapter editor (structured `chapters` jsonb is ready for it);
  public sharing (`is_public` + viewer route); per-person detail enrichment (`fetchPersonDetails`)
  for deeper bios; revive the profile StoryTab "AI Rewrite" button (bio isn't editable in
  `PersonProfile` today). Note: the Books panel needs the tree archive loaded first (same as the
  GEDCOM panel) — consider loading `allPeople` on tree selection so admin panels work without first
  visiting Interactive Tree.

### K. DNA analysis & visualization
Extends SPEC §6.1 (ingestion) / §6.3 (lineage resolution); new SPEC ground — flag a §6 update. Turn
DNA from a per-match verdict into a tree-wide analytical surface. The cM classifier, shared-segment
parser, and lineage resolver already exist — the gap is higher-order analysis and the consent work
that gates raw data.

> **Done 2026-06-22 — K1 (engine):** [../lib/dnaClustering.ts](../lib/dnaClustering.ts) groups
> shared-segment matches into triangulation clusters via union-find (min-cM filter, 11 tests) — the
> clustering engine underpinning K1/K5. Remaining: wire it into the DNA admin panel as a
> "cluster matches" view.

- **K1. Segment triangulation / Leeds-method clustering.** Group shared matches into the four
  grandparent clusters by shared-segment overlap. Reuse the per-segment data already parsed in
  [../lib/dnaRawParser.ts](../lib/dnaRawParser.ts) (`parseSharedSegmentsCsv`,
  `parseFtdnaSharedSegmentsCsv`), the cluster labels in
  [../lib/dnaClassification.ts](../lib/dnaClassification.ts), and the `dna_matches` schema. Deeper
  design: `sources/dna-triangulation.md` (to be written).
- **K2. MRCA suggestion from shared matches + cM.** Propose most-recent-common-ancestor candidates
  by combining the shortest-path resolver with shared-match overlap. Reuse
  `resolveSharedMatchLineage` / `resolveSharedTestLineage` in
  [../services/archive.ts](../services/archive.ts) and `supportsRelationshipHops` in
  `lib/dnaClassification.ts`. *(Note: the resolver lives in `services/archive.ts`, not the admin
  panel — the panel only calls it.)*
- **K3. In-tree auto-placement of unknown matches.** When a match has no person row, use the
  resolver to suggest where they slot in. Reuse `resolveSharedMatchLineage`, `persons.is_dna_match` /
  `dna_match_info`. Extends [concepts/dna-lineage-verification.md](concepts/dna-lineage-verification.md).
- **K4. Y / mtDNA haplogroup migration display.** Map `DNATest.haplogroup` (already stored) →
  migration route on tester profiles. Needs an external haplogroup→route reference dataset.
- **K5. DNA-painter-style segment view.** Per-chromosome bar of shared segments colored by cluster.
  Reuse the shared-segment parser output + K1 clusters.
- **K6. Raw-autosomal ingestion beyond CSV.** `parseAutosomalCsv` is shallow
  (rsid/chromosome/position preview only); full per-SNP matching is a different scale problem — the
  heavy lift. **Blocked by K7.** Reuse [../lib/dnaRawParser.ts](../lib/dnaRawParser.ts).
- **K7. Consent + encryption-at-rest for raw biometric DNA.** Raw autosomal DNA is sensitive,
  immutable, hereditary data. Add `consent_given_at` / `consent_scope` on `dna_tests`; encrypt at
  rest or don't persist (minimize first); keep out of the public read path. Policy:
  [decisions/raw-dna-consent-and-encryption.md](decisions/raw-dna-consent-and-encryption.md); ties
  to SPEC §8.
- **Sequencing:** K7 → K6 → K1 → K5 (consent gates raw ingestion gates triangulation gates painter).

### L. Interactive tree enhancements
Extends SPEC §7 (performance); new UI views are new SPEC ground. The pedigree view
([../components/InteractiveTree/PedigreeTree.tsx](../components/InteractiveTree/PedigreeTree.tsx)) is
solid but single-mode. These add alternate lenses (DNA-aware, spatial, chronological) without
replacing the layout engine in [../lib/pedigreeLayout.ts](../lib/pedigreeLayout.ts).

> **Done 2026-06-22 — L1 (DNA edges); 2026-06-26 — confidence edges; 2026-06-27 — shared-cM (L1
> complete):** DNA-backed pedigree edges trace emerald; non-DNA edges encode `RelationshipConfidence`
> (Confirmed bold indigo → Speculative faint dashed; unset keeps the default lineage indigo); and each
> DNA badge now shows the **strongest backing shared-cM** beneath the match count, with the cM repeated
> in the edge hover tooltip — all in
> [../components/InteractiveTree/PedigreeTree.tsx](../components/InteractiveTree/PedigreeTree.tsx). The
> cM join: App collects the match ids stamped on `relationships.metadata.dna_support_by_person`
> ([../lib/dnaSupport.ts](../lib/dnaSupport.ts)) and fetches `dna_matches.shared_cm` by id
> ([../services/archive.ts](../services/archive.ts) `fetchDnaMatchCm`) — `dna_matches` has no `tree_id`
> (RLS scopes via `persons`), so it's fetched by id set, not per tree. **L1 is complete.**

- **L1. DNA-aware tree overlay — DONE 2026-06-27 (complete).** Edges encode `RelationshipConfidence`
  (color/style) and DNA-backed edges surface **shared-cM** on the badge + hover tooltip, joined from
  `dna_matches.shared_cm` by the match ids in `dna_support_by_person`. Reused the existing confidence
  enum + `relationships.metadata.dna_support_by_person`. Extends D.
- **L2. Fan / pedigree-compact view.** Alternate renderer for 8+ ancestor generations. Reuse
  [../lib/pedigreeLayout.ts](../lib/pedigreeLayout.ts) +
  [../lib/pedigreeScope.ts](../lib/pedigreeScope.ts) (ancestor depth already capped at 8).
- **L3. Timeline / chronological view.** Persons/events on a time axis. Reuse `person_events` +
  birth/death-year helpers.
- **L4. Map / migration view.** Plot persons/events by `StructuredPlace.lat`/`lng` over a basemap;
  animate migration paths. **New runtime dependency (a map lib) — flag before starting.**
- **L5. Keyboard navigation + search-to-focus + breadcrumbs.** UX polish. Reuse
  [../lib/pedigreeScope.ts](../lib/pedigreeScope.ts).
- **L6. Tree export as PNG / SVG / PDF.** Client-side canvas/SVG serialization. Model on the
  `@media print` pattern in `components/book/*`.
- **L7. Side-by-side person / tree compare.** Two-focus view. Reuse
  [../lib/pedigreeScope.ts](../lib/pedigreeScope.ts).
- **Virtualization for large trees folds under existing G / SPEC §7**, not a new L item — G already
  covers "no full-tree hydration."
- **Sequencing:** L1 first (cheap, high-visibility); then L4 (map) as the showcase; the rest as
  capacity allows.

### M. AI family books & biography editing
Builds on J. Extends SPEC §3.5 (admin workspace) and adds a public viewer; grounding policy ties to
§8. The books pillar works end-to-end (compose → persist → print-to-PDF) and per-person biographies
persist with signatures + staleness detection — **but both are effectively read-only after
generation.** Books are write-once (no chapter editing, reorder, or single-chapter regen);
biographies are AI-generate-only in the StoryTab (no manual text editing). The schemas are already
structured for editing, so M makes human editing first-class and deepens generation quality. Policy
foundation: [decisions/ai-narrative-editing-and-grounding.md](decisions/ai-narrative-editing-and-grounding.md).

> **Done 2026-06-22 — editing + grounding arc; 2026-06-27 — M3:** M6 (manual biography editing), M1
> (in-UI book editor), M2 (single-chapter regen), M7 (richer inputs: life events + sources), M11
> (fact-grounding footers + hedged prose), M10 (AI-assisted text ops), M12 (retire legacy
> `generateBio`), and M3 (richer book structure: `section` divider kind, per-chapter `status`
> draft/edited/locked with a lock toggle, and a section-aware TOC + divider pages). Remaining: M4
> (versioning); M5 (public viewer) is gated by roadmap **A** (multi-user auth).

*Book creation & editing:*

- **M1. In-UI book editor (highest book-leverage).** The `chapters` jsonb is already structured
  (`BookChapter` = kind/title/personId?/narrative/facts?). Add: inline edit of chapter text, reorder
  (drag or up/down), add/remove custom chapters (intro, photo essay, source appendix), edit titles.
  Reuse `BookChapter` + `saveFamilyBook` in [../services/books.ts](../services/books.ts). Deeper
  design: `sources/book-editor.md` (to be written).
- **M2. Single-chapter regeneration.** Today only "force-regenerate all." Add per-chapter
  "regenerate" (and "regenerate with different style/length") via `composePersonBiography` /
  `composeFamilyOverview` in [../services/ai.ts](../services/ai.ts). The composer already works
  chapter-by-chapter — just expose one chapter.
- **M3. Richer book structure — DONE 2026-06-27.** `BookChapterKind` is now `'overview' | 'person' |
  'custom' | 'section'` (the `section` kind is a structural Part divider); each chapter carries an
  optional `status` (`'draft' | 'edited' | 'locked'`) that the editor surfaces as a badge + lock
  toggle (locking freezes the text + Regenerate), and the print/preview TOC groups chapters under
  section headers with divider pages. `status` rides the existing `chapters` jsonb — no migration.
- **M4. Book versioning + draft/publish.** `status` exists (`draft`/`complete`) but there's no real
  history. Add version snapshots of `chapters` (a `family_book_versions` table or jsonb snapshots)
  + a publish flow that fixes a viewer-facing snapshot.
- **M5. Public book sharing viewer.** `is_public` + an RLS policy already exist but there's no
  public viewer UI. Build the read-only viewer route + shareable link; print-to-PDF already works.

*Biography editing & generation:*

- **M6. Manual biography editing in StoryTab (highest bio-leverage).** Today
  [../components/person-profile/StoryTab.tsx](../components/person-profile/StoryTab.tsx) shows
  biography read-only with only AI Generate/Rewrite. Add an editable textarea (admin) that persists
  to `person_biographies.narrative` with `is_manual = true` — **the flag already exists.** AI
  rewrite becomes a starting point, not the only path. Reuse `upsertPersonBiography` in
  [../services/books.ts](../services/books.ts). Deeper design: `sources/biography-editing.md` (to be
  written).
- **M7. Richer biography inputs (`fetchPersonDetails`).** Composition uses only the provided
  `Person` object today (J flags this). Pull deeper context: events, occupations timeline,
  sources/citations, and already-composed relative narratives. Reuse/expand `buildChapterFacts` +
  `BookChapterFacts` in [../lib/bookComposer.ts](../lib/bookComposer.ts).
- **M8. Per-biography style/tone controls + variants.** StoryTab hardcodes
  `{style:'narrative', length:'medium'}` today. Expose style/length/language pickers per person, and
  consider a `variant` dimension (the table is keyed by `(person_id, language)` only; provenance
  cols `style`/`length`/`model` already exist).
- **M9. Streaming generation UX.** All AI calls are request→full-response with a progress bar
  today. Stream biography/chapter text token-by-token via OpenRouter SSE for better perceived
  performance on long bios. Add streaming variants alongside the cached path.
- **M10. AI-assisted editing (selection ops, not full regen).** Once text is editable (M1/M6), add
  operations on a selection: "rewrite this paragraph," "make more formal," "expand with sources,"
  "translate to [lang]."
- **M11. Citation & fact-grounding in generated text.** Generated bios/books can hallucinate, which
  matters in genealogy. Have the composer cite which facts/events/sources each passage draws from,
  and flag ungrounded sentences as narrative interpolation. Reuse the existing sources/citation
  system; policy in the decision doc above. Pairs with M7.
- **M12. Retire legacy `generateBio`.** [../services/ai.ts](../services/ai.ts) `generateBio`
  (~L416–446) is unused (books use `composePersonBiography`). Remove it — housekeeping, like B.
- **Sequencing:** M6 + M1 (editing foundation, parallel) → M2 → M7 → M11 → M10 → M3/M4/M5. M9 runs
  in parallel; M12 anytime.

### N. Server-side AI proxy + key protection + cost guardrails (SECURITY — flag before public scale)
Today every OpenRouter call runs **client-side** with `Authorization: Bearer ${apiKey}`
([../services/ai.ts](../services/ai.ts) ~L359/L395) and there is **no edge/serverless layer**
(`supabase/functions` is absent). The key — whether from env or the admin AI settings table — reaches
the browser, so anyone who can read the settings or sniff network traffic can exfiltrate it and spend
against the account. There's also no per-tree usage metering or rate limit.
- Move AI calls behind a **Supabase Edge Function** (or similar) that holds the key server-side; the
  client sends prompts, never the key. Ties to the `admin_ai_settings` model already in the schema.
- Add usage logging + a per-tree/day cap; surface spend in the admin Database panel.
- Pairs with **K7** (raw-DNA never on the public path) as the security track. Until done, treat the
  configured key as burnable and scope/rotate it.

### O. Data-quality / consistency engine ("Research issues") — DONE 2026-06-26
The pure engine + admin panel shipped: [../lib/dataQuality.ts](../lib/dataQuality.ts) runs
death-before-birth / burial-before-death / implausible-lifespan / parent-age / child-after-death /
duplicate-person checks (unit-tested), surfaced read-only in **Administrator → Research**
([../components/admin/AdminResearchPanel.tsx](../components/admin/AdminResearchPanel.tsx)). On the real
2148-person tree it flags ~10 errors. **Remaining:** dismiss / convert-to-`Discrepancy`-note actions,
and the optional "suggest next record to find" AI layer.
A genealogy-native validation pass that surfaces likely errors as actionable items. The schema
already has `note_type = 'Discrepancy'`/`'To-do'` and `lib/lifespan.ts` (130-yr cap) to build on.
- Checks: parent younger than child / child born before parent; death before birth; burial before
  death; child born >~10 mo after father's death or after mother's death; marriage/parenthood under a
  plausible age; impossible lifespans; **duplicate-person detection** (same name + overlapping dates).
- Surface as a tree-level **"Research issues"** panel and per-person badges; let an admin dismiss or
  convert an issue into a `Discrepancy` note. Pure, unit-testable in a `lib/dataQuality.ts`.
- Optional AI layer: suggest the *next record to find* given what vitals/sources are present (pairs
  with P/§ research log).

### P. Relationship calculator + path finder — DONE 2026-06-26
Shipped: [../lib/relationshipCalculator.ts](../lib/relationshipCalculator.ts) finds the MRCA, derives
the label (parent / grandparent / sibling / half-sibling / aunt-uncle / niece-nephew / cousin with
degree + removed) and reconstructs the A→B path (unit-tested). Rendered as a card in **Administrator →
Research** ([../components/admin/RelationshipCalculator.tsx](../components/admin/RelationshipCalculator.tsx))
with two person pickers (self-loads the archive). Feeds L (tree nav) and is reusable for K2 (MRCA).
"How is A related to B?" and "show the path between A and B" across the tree. Reuse the lineage
resolver + [../lib/pedigreeScope.ts](../lib/pedigreeScope.ts); render cousin-degree/removed labels
(the cM-range tables in [sources/dna-cm-ranges.md](sources/dna-cm-ranges.md) already encode the
relationship vocabulary). Feeds L (tree navigation), K2 (MRCA), and the DNA verdicts.

### Q. Media intelligence (faces, tagging, OCR, per-person gallery)
The media store + AI vision are both live (`transcribeRecordImage`, `media_person_links` with
`event_label`). Build on them: tag people in a photo (write `media_person_links`), AI auto-caption,
optional face-grouping, and a **per-person photo timeline/gallery**. Document images can reuse the
transcription pipeline for searchable OCR text. New runtime deps (a face model) must be flagged.

### R. Patronymic & Nordic naming intelligence (folds toward I)
Danish/Swedish/Norwegian records are patronymic-heavy. Add: derive/validate `-sen/-son/-datter/-dotter`
from a parent's given name, detect soldier/farm names, and normalize name variants for search and
duplicate detection (O). Complements the historical-date work in **I** and the parish-record
transcription already shipped. Keep raw name text verbatim (same fidelity rule as dates/places).

### S. Full UI internationalization + public share surface
Books are i18n'd (`lib/bookI18n.ts`) but the **app chrome is English-only**, while the product is
public-first. Localize the whole UI (da default + sv/no/en, reuse the `bookI18n` pattern), add
per-person/tree **OpenGraph share cards** and a sitemap for public trees (SEO). Pairs with M5 (public
book viewer) and A (multi-user).

### T. Data portability, backup & admin undo
`audit_logs` already records every mutation with actor + details. Leverage it: a one-click
**revert/undo** for recent admin actions, scheduled full-tree **JSON/GEDCOM-7 backup**, and a GDPR
"export everything for person/tree" + hard-delete path (ties to K7's deletable-on-demand rule).

## Maintenance note (2026-06-23)
The 2026-06-22/23 work (M-series editing arc, L1, K1, husky hooks, DNA panel fixes) is **committed and
reflected here, but `log.md` was not updated for it** — the living log's newest entry is 2026-06-21,
so it's now behind the code. Backfill `log.md` from `git log` (commits `ae0299d`→`a7f9359`) to restore
the "newest at top" history. Also: two untracked artifacts sit in the working tree
(`FamilySearchGEDCOMv7.pdf`, a generated `… Hass-Jensen.pdf`) — gitignore them.

## Known stale references
- ✅ Resolved 2026-06-20: GEDCOM *parsing* now lives in `lib/gedcomParser.ts` (extracted from
  `ImportExport.tsx`); persistence is still `importGedcomToSupabase` in `services/archive.ts`,
  and GEDCOM *export* is still inline in `ImportExport.tsx`. `docs/CONTENT_MAP.md` updated; check
  `AGENT.md` for any remaining `lib/gedcom/*` mentions.

## How to pick the next item
Two lenses:
- **If anything ships publicly soon → N (server-side AI proxy)** first. The OpenRouter key is in the
  browser today; that has to move server-side before a wider audience can reach the app. Cheap
  relative to its risk.
- **For product leverage → A (multi-user auth)** — it unblocks M5 (public book viewer) and live
  verification of the book features (the local admin can't read saved books today; see the RLS note).

For user-facing progress on the themed groups (small, high-visibility wins): **wire K1 into the DNA
panel** (the clustering engine exists in `lib/dnaClustering.ts` but is **not yet referenced by any UI**
— see caveat below), or **H P1** (the GEDCOM 7.0 structured-date spine — lossless dates, also fixes
export round-trip ids).
Confirm priority with the user before large changes.

> **K1 correctness caveat:** `clusterSharedSegments` currently joins matches that overlap the *kit
> owner* on the same region. True triangulation/Leeds also requires the two matches to share that
> segment **with each other** (in-common-with) and to be on the **same parental side** — overlapping
> the owner's region on opposite parental chromosomes is a false cluster. Fold in ICW / parental-side
> data before presenting clusters as confirmed shared-ancestor groups.
